# Reverse Polish Notation language

- __rpn__ is a reverse polish notation mathematical language, which brings powerfull calculation facilities on floating point number with __arbitrary precision__

- The special feature of this language is to make no difference between keywords and functions, even user functions

- Following objects are managed: floating numbers, symbols, strings, programs, plus language keywords (commands and flow controls)

- Inspired by Hewlett-Packard RPL language (**HP28S** user manual is provided as a reference), it includes at least STACK, STORE, BRANCH, TEST, TRIG and LOGS commands of HP28S RPL implementation

- A __GNU-readline__-based interactive editor with autocompletion is provided.

Multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding are ensured by __MPFR library__ under LGPL v3

Default float mode is 'std' with 20 digits

Default floating point precision is 128 bits

Default rounding mode is 'nearest' 

## Tests

Unit tests are given as txt files in the test subdirectory.

Use the command 'test' to run a test file, eg
```
# cd src_directory/
# rpn
rpn> "test/01-all.txt"
rpn> test
## ENTRY TEST
(...)
# real decimal PASSED
# real hex PASSED
# real binary PASSED
(...)
```

The test output is done on stdout and is not stacked in rpn.

| entry.txt | testing real, binary, symbol, string and program entries |
